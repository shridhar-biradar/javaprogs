 1. Explain differen types of Errors in java.
   In any programming language we categorise errors into 2 types
* Syntax Error/CompileTime Mistakes
*  Logical Error/RunTimeMistakes

Syntax error/CompileTime Mistakes
* It referd to the mistakes done by the programmer with respect to syntax
* These mistakes are identified by the compiler, so we say it as "CompileTimeMistake


Logical Error/RunTimeMistakes
* it refers to the mistakes done by the programmer with respect to syntax
* these mistakes are identified by jvm during the execution of a program,so we say it as "RunTimeMistake

2. Whatis an Excepaion in java .
   An unwnted/expected event that disturbs the normal flow of execution of a program is called "Ecception handling".
* the main objective of exception handling is to handale the exception
*it is available for graceful termination of program

3.How can you handle exception in java? explain with example
  Exception handling can be performed using:
Try: the set of statements or code which requires monitoring for an exception is kept under this block.
Catch:this catch all exception that were trapped in try block.
Finally:this  block is always preformed irrespective of the catching exception in the try or ctch block.
Ex: class Lanch{
     public static void main(String[] args)
{
try{
   System.out.println("hello" +" " +1/0);
  }
catch(ArithmeticException e){
   System.out.printn("world");
    
  }
}
}

4.Why do you need exception handling in java?
  if there is no try and catch block while an exception occurs,the program will terminate. Exception handling ensure the smooth runing of program without program termination

5.what is the difference between exception and error in java
  Error typically happen while an apllication is running.For instance ,Out of memory Error occurs in case the jvm run out of memory. on the other hand Exception are mainly caused by the application.For instance, null pointer Exception happens when an app tries to get through a null object.

6.Name the different types of exception in java
  Based on handling by the JVM,there are typicaly two types of exception in java:
Checked:occur during the compilation.Here the compiler checks whether the exception is handled and throws an error accordingly
unchecked: occur during program execution.These are not detectable during the Compilation process.

7.can we just use try instead of finally and catch blocks? give an example
  No, doing so will show a compilatopn error,Catch or Finally block must always accomany try block.We can remove either finally block or catch block,but never both.
