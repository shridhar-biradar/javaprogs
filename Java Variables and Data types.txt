1.What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programing Language?
  Dynamically-typed languages ​​perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages ​​perform type checking at compile time

2.What is the variable in Java?
  Variables are containers for storing data values . In Java, there are different types of variables, for example: String ,Integers

3.How to Assign a value To variable?
  The first time a variable is assigned a value, it is said to be initialised. The = symbol is known as the assignment operator . It is also possible to declare a variable and assign it a value in the same line, so instead of int i and then i = 9 we can write int i = 9

4.What are Primitive Data types in Java?
  Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char .

5.what are the identifiers in java?
  All Java variables must be identified with unique names . These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

6.List the Operators in Java?
 * Unary Operators.
 * Arithmetic Operators.
 * Assignment Operators.
 * Logical Operators.
 * Shift Operators.
 * Bitwise Operators.
 * Ternary Operators.
 * Relational Operators.

7.Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples
 Suppose a and b are int variables and: a = 5; b = 10 + (++a); To execute the second statement, first the value of a is incremented to 6. Then, 10 is added to 6 to get 16, which is then assigned to b .
 A decrement is a programming operator that decreases the numerical value of its operand by 1
