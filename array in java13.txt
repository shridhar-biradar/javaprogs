1.What is the default value of array for different data types
Numeric Data Types (int, short, long, byte, float, double): The default value is 0 for numeric types.

char: The default value is '\u0000', which represents the null character.

boolean: The default value is false for boolean types.

Object References: For arrays of objects (e.g., String[], Object[]), the default value is null. This means that initially, all elements in the array will be references to null objects.

2.Can you pass the negative number in array size
No

3.Where does array stored in jvm memory
Heap Memory

4.what are the disadvantages of array
Fixed Size
Inefficient Insertion and Deletion
Wasted Memory
Homogeneous Data

5. what is an anonymous array in java? Give an example
An array in Java without any name is known as an anonymous array

ex:new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4};  
    new char[] {'x', 'y', 'z'}; 


6. What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java
Using For Loop (Traditional Loop)
Using Enhanced For Loop (Foreach Loop)
Using While Loop
Using Arrays.stream()

7. What is the difference between length and length() method give an example
 length (Array Length):

length is a property used to determine the length (size) of an array.
It is applicable to arrays, which are fixed-size collections of elements.
Arrays in Java have a predefined length property that represents the number of elements in the array. 

length() (String Length):

length() is a method used to determine the length (number of characters) of a string.
It is applicable to instances of the String class.
length() is a method, so it requires parentheses when called.

public class LengthVsLengthMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int arrayLength = numbers.length;
        System.out.println("Array Length: " + arrayLength);

        
        String text = "Hello, World!";
        int stringLength = text.length();
        System.out.println("String Length: " + stringLength);
    }
}
