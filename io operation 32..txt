1. What is input and output stream in java
   A stream can be defined as a sequence of data.The stream is used to read data from a source and output stream is used tfor writing data to destination.

2. what are the methods of outputStream
  * write()-writes the specified byte to the output stream
  * write(byte[] array)- write the byte from the specified array to the output stream
  * flush()-forces to write all data present in the output stream to the destination
  *close()-close the output stream


3. what is serialization in java
   serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to transfer it over a network or to store it in a file or database.In java serialization is done by implementing the serializable inteface

4. what is the serializable interface in java
   serializable interface in java is a marker interface that has no methods. It is used to mark classes that can be serialized,meaning their objective instance can be converted into a stream of bytes

5. what is deserializable in java
   it is process of converting  a stream of bytes back into an object instance . This is down after an object has been serialized

6. how is serialization achieved in java
   serialization is achieved in java by implementing the serializable interface. When an object is serialized,its state is converted into a stream of bytes , which can then be transfered over a network or stored in a file or data base

7. how is deserialization achieved in java
   deserialization is achieved in java by reading a stream of bytes and using them to recreate the original object instance. This is down by calling the readObject() method of an ObjectInputStream instance

8. how can you avoid certain member variable of class from getting seriallized
   Mark member variables as static or transient and those member variables will no more be a part of serialization

9.what classes are available in the java IO file Classws API
   the following classes are available in the java IO API and are important to work with files in java 
File 
RandomAccessFile
FileInputStream
FileReader
FileOutputStream
FileWriter

10. what is difference between externalizable and serialization interface

->serializable
* it is a marker interface and it doesn't have any method
* serializable provides its own default serialization process we just need to implement a serializable interface
* we can customize default serialization process by defining following methods in our class readObject() and writeObject()
* it provides less control
* over serialization as it's not mandatory to define readObject() and writeObject() methods
* Constructor is not called during desrialization

->Externalizable
* it is not a marker interface
* it has a method called writeExternal() and readExternal()
* we need to override writeExternal() and readExternal() for the serialization process to happen
* serialization process is completely customized
* we need to override the externalizable interface writeExternal() and readExternal() methods
* externalizable provides
* constructore is called during deserialization
